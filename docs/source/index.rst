IAI MovieBot |release| documentation
=====================================

IAI MovieBot is a conversational recommender system for movies.  It follows a standard task-oriented dialogue system architecture, comprising of natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue manager (DM), and natural language generation (NLG) components.  The distinctive features of IAI MovieBot include a task-specific dialogue flow, a multi-modal chat interface, and an effective way to deal with dynamically changing user preferences.  While our current focus is limited to movies, the system aims to be a reusable development framework that can support users in accomplishing recommendation-related goals via multi-turn conversations.
