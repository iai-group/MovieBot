- In 1858, a bounty hunter named Schultz seeks out a slave named Django and buys him
  because he needs him to find some men he is looking for. After finding them, Django
  wants to find his wife, Broomhilda, who along with him were sold separately by his
  former owner for trying to escape. Schultz offers to help him if he chooses to stay
  with him and be his partner. Eventually they learn that she was sold to a plantation
  in Mississippi. Knowing they can't just go in and say they want her, they come up
  with a plan so that the owner will welcome them into his home and they can find
  a way.
- 'Unlike any other film, book, or article produced about Mumia Abu-Jamal, "Mumia:
  Long Distance Revolutionary" focuses on his career as a prolific author and broadcaster
  from Pennsylvania''s Death Row. In fact, the film does not deal with Abu-Jamal''s
  case, but rather chronicles his life and work as a journalist and revolutionary
  - both prior and post incarceration. After Abu-Jamal is convicted for the murder
  of of Philadelphia patrolman Daniel Faulkner, the story then exposes Abu-Jamal''s
  battles with the American court system to continue his work from prison- a battle
  he continues to wage to this very day.'
- Following the events of Night of the Living Dead (1968), we follow the exploits
  of four survivors of the expanding zombie apocalypse as they take refuge in an abandoned
  shopping mall following a horrific SWAT evacuation of an apartment complex. Taking
  stock of their surroundings, they arm themselves, lock down the mall, and destroy
  the zombies inside so they can eke out a living--at least for a while. Tensions
  begin to build as months go on, and they come to realize that they've fallen prey
  to consumerism. Soon afterward, they have even heavier problems to worry about,
  as a large gang of bikers discovers the mall and invades it, ruining the survivors'
  best-laid plans and forcing them to fight off both lethal bandits and flesh-eating
  zombies.
- "A unique celebration of the Queen's ninety years as she reaches her landmark birthday\
  \ in April. Film-maker John Bridcut has been granted special access to the complete\
  \ collection of Her Majesty's personal cin\xE9 films, shot by the Duke of Edinburgh\
  \ and the Queen herself, as well as by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen\

  \ and his sister Princess Alexandra, who has never before given an interview."
- It is a world within our world, yet unseen by any human, and the beings here control
  time and tide and the changing of the seasons. On the day Chun turns sixteen, she
  is transformed into a dolphin to explore the human world. She is rescued from a
  vortex by a human boy at the cost of his own life. Chun is so moved by the boy's
  kindness and courage that she decides to give him life again. But to do this, she
  must protect the boy's soul, a tiny fish, and nurture it to grow. Through adventure
  and sacrifice, love grows, yet now she must release him back to the sea, back to
  life in the human world.
- Olga, Katya, and Andrey have known each other since childhood. They moved to Moscow
  many years ago and have become successful. Olga is an actress, Katya works for a
  large-scale PR agency, and Andrey is a political analyst. They buy cars, take mortgages,
  build country houses. Just like everybody else. But their lives bring them neither
  happiness nor content. The feeling of "something's not right but I can't put my
  finger on it" underpins the lives of today's thirty-year-olds. Their childhood took
  place during the Soviet era, when kids dreamed of becoming heroes, believed in spy
  stories and a bright future. Yet nobody expected that the dream of becoming a hero
  would be replaced by the dream of stable and predictable existence. People have
  stopped dreaming of truly grand things. They just play their roles.
- Brian Wilson is the creative soul of the Beach Boys, but he paid a heavy price for
  his talent. That especially shows during his peak artistic years in the 1960s, as
  his inner demons and obsessions trying to please his abusive father drive him to
  a mental breakdown that would plague him for years. In the 1980s, with Brian barely
  functional under the domination of the unscrupulous Dr. Landy, Brian meets and falls
  in love with Melinda Ledbetter. As their relationship grows, she observes Brian's
  crippling subservience to the abusive psychotherapist with growing alarm. Ultimately,
  she must take action with a love willing to stand up to oppression she cannot ignore.
- This character study joins the painter at the height of his fame in 1642, when his
  adored wife suddenly dies and his work takes a dark, sardonic turn that offends
  his patrons. By 1656, he is bankrupt but consoles himself with the company of pretty
  maid Hendrickje, whom he's unable to marry. Their relationship brings ostracism
  but also some measure of happiness. The final scenes find him in his last year,
  1669, physically enfeebled but his spirit undimmed.
- The film revolves around four brothers who share a love-hate relationship with each
  other. Franky's elder brothers, Saji, Bobby and Bony lead a messed up life with
  their downright arrogance, differences, and disagreements with each other. Each
  one deals with the struggle of his own. Their relationship progresses to another
  level when Saji, Boney, and Franky decide to help Bobby stand by his love. Franky's
  wish for a beautiful home cuddles hope.
- Based on the New York Times bestseller, WONDER tells the incredibly inspiring and
  heartwarming story of August Pullman. Born with facial differences that, up until
  now, have prevented him from going to a mainstream school, Auggie becomes the most
  unlikely of heroes when he enters the local fifth grade. As his family, his new
  classmates, and the larger community all struggle to discover their compassion and
  acceptance, Auggie's extraordinary journey will unite them all and prove you can't
  blend in when you were born to stand out.
