        of four survivors of the expanding zombie apocalypse as they take refuge in
        an abandoned shopping mall following a horrific SWAT evacuation of an apartment
        complex. Taking stock of their surroundings, they arm themselves, lock down
        the mall, and destroy the zombies inside so they can eke out a living--at
        least for a while. Tensions begin to build as months go on, and they come
        to realize that they've fallen prey to consumerism. Soon afterward, they have
        even heavier problems to worry about, as a large gang of bikers discovers
        the mall and invades it, ruining the survivors' best-laid plans and forcing
        them to fight off both lethal bandits and flesh-eating zombies.

        country called Genovia. Suddenly Mia's life is thrown into complete overload.
        She's being taught about scarves, waves, and pears in order to become a perfect
        Princess, she gets a makeover and a tough looking, yet sweet bodyguard and
        limo driver called Joe (Hector Elizondo). Things get out of hand when the

        in the newspapers and in school. On top of all of that, Mia has a choice to

        to relinquish her claim on the throne or to become the Princess and heir to
        the throne her father, Philippe Renaldi (Rene Auberjonois), and grandmother
        want her to be.

      - Olga, Katya, and Andrey have known each other since childhood. They moved
        to Moscow many years ago and have become successful. Olga is an actress, Katya
        works for a large-scale PR agency, and Andrey is a political analyst. They
        buy cars, take mortgages, build country houses. Just like everybody else.
        But their lives bring them neither happiness nor content. The feeling of "something's
        not right but I can't put my finger on it" underpins the lives of today's
        thirty-year-olds. Their childhood took place during the Soviet era, when kids
        dreamed of becoming heroes, believed in spy stories and a bright future. Yet
        nobody expected that the dream of becoming a hero would be replaced by the
        dream of stable and predictable existence. People have stopped dreaming of
        truly grand things. They just play their roles.
